# Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible Disease Spread Model

Bidimensional Cell-DEVS adaptation of the Geo-Entity Cellular Automata presented by [Zhong et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11430-009-0044-9).
However, rules have been re-interpreted by [Kevin Henares](mailto:khenares@ucm.es).


## How to run the model:

For running the model with von Neumann neighborhood, in the linux terminal, type:
```shell
> ../cd++ -m"sirs_zhong.ma" -l"results_zhong/sirs_zhong.log"
```
