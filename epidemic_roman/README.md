# Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Disease Spread Model

Yet another Cell-DEVS implementation of the cellular automata model presented by [Hoya White et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2006.06.126).
However, rules have been re-interpreted by [Román Cárdenas](mailto:r.cardenas@upm.es).


## How to run the model:

In the linux terminal, type:  
```shell
> ./../cd++ -mSsir_roman.ma -lresults/sir_roman.log
```
